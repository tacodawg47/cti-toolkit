# CTI Toolkit

Local-only cyber threat intelligence toolkit: many analyst tools under one
web interface. Portfolio project and daily workflow aid.

Read ROADMAP.md first. It holds the phases, stack, decisions log, and open
questions. Work proceeds phase by phase in the order listed there.

## Working agreement

- The user is new to Python, FastAPI, and web development. Explain choices
  briefly as you go and keep the code readable over clever.
- Deterministic core. No AI anywhere except the final "assist" phase, and
  that must be optional with a "none" provider as the default.
- The app binds to 127.0.0.1 only.
- Code must run on Linux (primary) and Windows. Use pathlib, no shell-specific
  calls, no hard-coded paths.
- API keys live in .env (git-ignored). Never commit secrets. Never print keys.
- Reuse open source tools by wrapping them. The MIT-licensed cti-skills plugin
  (Liberty91) has stdlib Python vendor clients and dark web scripts worth
  porting with attribution.
- Prefer small, testable modules: one package per tool under app/modules/,
  shared code under app/core/.
- No automated joining of Telegram channels, no engagement with threat
  actors, no purchases, no bypassing of anti-bot protections.
